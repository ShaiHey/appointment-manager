    "secret": "MySecret",
    "jwtSecret": "MyJwtSecret",
    "lang": "en",

  },
  "mongoose": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 27017,
    "database": "appointmentApp"
  },
  "mail": {
    "auth": {
      "user": "mail@gmail.com",
      "pass": "appPasswordGmail"
    }
  }
}
```

> ✅ Only fill in:
>
> * `mail.auth.user` & `pass`

## 📩 Email Reminder

A cron job runs every 5 minutes to check if any appointment is scheduled in the next hour, and sends an email reminder automatically (via Gmail SMTP).

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
* **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
* **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
* **Email**: Nodemailer with Gmail
* **Internationalization**: Custom `i18n` system

---

## 🧪 Development

### Start backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Start frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

## 🐳 Docker

If you prefer using Docker, you can launch the entire application with a single command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the backend, frontend, and MongoDB database (if configured in the `docker-compose.yml`).

> ✅ Make sure your `backend/config/default.json` is properly set before starting.

---

## ✅ Future Ideas

* Admin panel for user management
* Role-based access (employee vs. manager)
* Export appointments as CSV or PDF
* Better email templates (HTML)
